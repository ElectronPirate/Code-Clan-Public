# Clean Code Principles

**Lab Duration: 60 minutes**

“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” — Martin Fowler

## TASK:

In pairs research and create a 3 minute presentation on one or more Clean Code Principles. Choose a lab or homework you have done, or create some new code and review it using Clean Code Principles. What could you refactor to make the code 'cleaner'?
