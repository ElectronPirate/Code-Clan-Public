# Weekend Homework: React

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to create a React application with a component-based front-end
- Be able to trigger a rerender of the page on user interraction
- Be able to use React Router to display different 'pages'

## Option 1

### React App with Requests

### Brief

Your task is to create an application that makes a request to an API and displays the data.

Suggested APIs:

1. REST Countries: https://restcountries.eu/
2. Studio Ghibli: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/
3. Brewdog Beer: https://punkapi.com/

These APIs all allow browser requests without authentification or keys. If you choose to use a different API, make sure you are able to load the data into your application without issues, so that you can spend the time focussing on building your application. 

### MVP

- The application should display data from an API request.
- The application should allow the user to interract with the page in some way, for example, by filtering or sorting the data.
- Add a welcome/about page using React Router.

### Extensions

- Style with CSS

### Planning

- Draw out a component diagram detailing props and state.


## Option 2

### React Game: Tic-Tac-Toe

### Brief

Create a two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe (AKA Noughts & crosses) using React.

### MVP

- Add a rules page using React Router.
- A player should be able to click a square and see it display either a '0' or a 'X', depending on whose turn it is.

### Extensions

- When a row of either '0's or 'X's are displayed, a message should display saying the game has been won.
