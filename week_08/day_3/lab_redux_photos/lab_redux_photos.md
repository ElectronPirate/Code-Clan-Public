# Lab: React Redux Router Photographs

### Learning Objectives
- Be able to use Redux to manage application state in a React application
- Be able to use React Router with Redux

## Brief

You task is to build an application that allows users to browsers a collection of photos and favourite them. They should be able to navigate between two pages, one with all the photos display, and another that shows just the photos they have liked.

Use the data provided, which includes the images and initial photos data.

### MVP

- Enable a user to view all the photos one one page.
- Enable a user to favourite individual photos.
- Enable a user to navigate to a second page (using React Router) where they can view the photographs they have favourited.

### Extensions

- Enable the user to filter photos by category.
- Style with CSS.

### Considerations

Consider which components need to connect to the store, and which can be purely presentational components.

Also try and keep the filtering/sorting of data, and any business logic in the High Order Container Components, to keep the presentational components as easy to test as possible.
