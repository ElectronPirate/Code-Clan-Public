# Pair programming

**Lesson Duration: 10 minutes**

### Learning Objectives
- Know what Pair Programming is and is not

## What is Pair Programming?

### Super-simple Explanation:

  - two engineers working together to write one piece of code

### More Complicated Explanation:
  - one laptop
  - one "driving" and one "navigating"
    - driver writes code
    - navigator reviews code, makes suggestions and focuses on overall direction
  - continuous review of code
  - discussion! ("programming out loud")
    - driver explains code while writing it
    - navigator suggests changes/improvements and advises where to go next
    - both stop the other from deviating from good practices surrounding testing
  - knowledge sharing!

### What Pair Programming is NOT:
  - one engineer writing code while the other watches
  - two engineers writing code on separate laptops
  - silence
  - two engineers sharing a keyboard [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msX4oAXpvUE)
