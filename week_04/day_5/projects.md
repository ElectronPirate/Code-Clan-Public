# Project - Web Programming with JavaScript

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

- Object oriented programming with JavaScript
- Web Programming (REST APIs, Express, DOM manipulation)
- Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project must be built using:

- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript
- Express
- Postgres

## Briefs

These briefs detail what is expected of you, including an MVP. Note that the MVP is the **Minimum** Viable Product. You are strongly encouraged to go beyond these specifications, and some possible extensions are provided.

## Your Own Brief

If you have an idea for an app that you would like to build, talk through your ideas with an instructor before your start. You'll have to write your own brief.

## Submission

Submit a link to your Github repo through the Homework Submission form as soon as the repo has been created.

## Presentation

You will have 10 minutes to present your work, with 5 minutes for questions.

We expect you to:

- Show your sketches, notes, diagrams, wireframes and user planning
- Demonstrate your app's functionality
- Talk about some code that you are particularly proud of
- Highlight your main learning points

Do not:

- Talk through every single line of code
- Go over the time limit

## Asking for help

The instructional team will be on hand for technical assistance, but you are strongly encouraged to take this opportunity to practice self-sufficiency, as will be expected of you as a professional software developer.

Before asking an instructor for help this week, you should be ready to answer the following questions:

- What are you trying to achieve?
- What do you think the problem is?
- What have you tried so far?
- What did Google say about your error message?

## Attendance

The cohort will meet at the usual time every morning. Your attendance is recorded every day as normal.

## PDA Reminder

Remember to gather evidence for your PDA this week. This should only take 5 minutes:

- Go to your PDA Checklist
- Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to your own PDA repo
