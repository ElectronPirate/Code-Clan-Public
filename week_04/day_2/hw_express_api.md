# Express API

Tomorrow morning we'll do a quiz. You're homework is to make an API on the subject of your choice with Express and Postgres. I.E if you're into coffee, make a coffee API. Love Marvel? Create a Marvel API. You'll use this tomorrow to serve as an API to a front end.

You should have at least the following routes:

- INDEX (e.g. Get all the coffees)
- CREATE (e.g. Create a new coffee)
- DELETE (e.g. Delete a coffee)

Test your routes with Insomnia. You don't need a JS front end yet.
