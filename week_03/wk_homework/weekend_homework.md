# Homework: PubSub Requests and JavaScript Asychronicity

You homework is made up of three parts:

## Pub/Sub

Create a Pub/Sub application that makes an API request. See brief for details.

## Context

We have seen that JavaScript has various ways of declaring functions. One of the differences between these function types is their context, or in other words, what the value of the keyword `this` is inside the function body.

Watch the following video to develop your understanding: [https://youtu.be/z9Ir0muSp9I](https://youtu.be/z9Ir0muSp9I)

## Asynchronicity

Watch [What the Heck is the Event Loop?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&vl=en) video by Philip Roberts that explains how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.

### PDA Reminder:

Remember to gather evidence for your PDA this week. This should only take 5 minutes:

- Go to your [PDA Checklist](https://github.com/codeclan/pda/tree/master/Evidence%20Gathering%20Portfolio)

- Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to your own PDA repo
